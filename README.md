# FB Marketplace Discord Webhook Pusher

Tired of relying on unreliable facebook notifications?

Run this userscript instead that checks the FB Marketplace and pushes to a discord webhook instead!

## Steps to Run
Please ensure you have the location of you choosing configured. Sorted by new and listed within 7 days to have relevant postings!

Add the userscripts on a userscript extension of your browser. I am using Violentmonkey.
In the Usercripts configure the parameters to your liking as well!
You have to be logged into facebook for this to work! I'm running the userscripts on firefox in the background.

There are two Userscripts. One for opening tabs of unopened items in FB Marketplace Search on an interval. And the other is to push the tab of items onto the discord webhook.
